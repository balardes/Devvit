# Predictions

Predictions enable redditors to predict the outcome of an event or conversation. Who will win the game tomorrow? Which character will meet their fate in the next episode? Redditors can flex their knowledge of a topic by joining Predictions Tournaments (a series of Predictions) in their favorite subreddits.

## How predictions tournaments work

Here’s how Predictions are created and how redditors can join a Predictions Tournament:

1. Only moderators and moderator approved users can create a Predictions Tournament: A tournament is a series of questions where redditors predict the answers. Moderators can add as many questions as they want, even after the tournament has started.

2. Redditors predict: Each user gets 1,000 tokens when joining a Predictions Tournament and tokens are free. Users choose how many tokens to use for each prediction.

3. At the end of each prediction, mods resolve the outcomes, revealing who got the prediction right.

4. When a user is correct in their prediction they gain more Tokens based on how much they put in. The better a user’s predictions skills, the higher they climb on the scoreboard. When users run out of Tokens, they can’t participate in that Predictions Tournament anymore.

5. Tokens are only for use in the Predictions experience.
