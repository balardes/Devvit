Do you moderate a subreddit where the company can occasionally comment officially, but the company account is not a moderator?

Have you ever wanted the OP to give his reason for this post, but to see it in a sticky comment?

Have you ever wanted to pin someone else's comment to the top of a thread for whatever reason, but couldn't?

**Spotlight** is an app that allows OP and some legit users (let's say official company accounts) to have their comments pinned in a thread. Likewise, you have a mod option where you can pin someone else's comment, regardless of whether the commenter is the OP, a company or someone else!


**So, Spotlight can:**

• create a pinned comment written by the OP or by legit user (you should set a list of legit users in Dev settings) - user option

• pin comments from other users - mods only

• delete content created by the app - mods only


**Coming soon:**

• possibility to edit comments
• the possibility of automatic pinning of comments when a certain person comments in the thread

**Instructions**

• **OP** - if you want to publicly share why you think that your post should be visible, simply go to the post options and choose Spotlight.

[After that, you'll need to write something in this Devvit form. When you are done, just press OK.](https://preview.redd.it/introducing-spotlight-an-app-that-allows-op-and-approved-v0-y2sv0g9j3omd1.png?width=737&format=png&auto=webp&s=81481841ceb76fef0e98c7eb3d16239c298440aa)

Aaaand, that's it! If you'd like to delete this comment, ask mods.

* **Approved users**

First, moderators who have an access to Dev Platform should go to the app settings and add some legit users who will be able to use this option (mostly official accounts and popular subreddit helpers, but it's up to mods).

[Dev Settings](https://preview.redd.it/introducing-spotlight-an-app-that-allows-op-and-approved-v0-k59jfz5j5omd1.png?width=1305&format=png&auto=webp&s=408711e6dcd3b59bef769a9ff0c0e985a70f23f6)

Then do the same procedure, simply go to the post options and choose Spotlight (on the someone else's post).
